        <h3><li>Weights & Machines</li></h3>
        <p>Weights & Machines are tools used in strength training to build muscle and increase strength. Weights, such as dumbbells and barbells, provide resistance that the muscles work against during exercises. Machines are equipment that guide the movement and target specific muscle groups, <br> offering controlled resistance and helping ensure proper form. Both are essential for progressive overload, which is key to muscle growth.</p>
